            Great automation for freelancers. Integration with the bank account
            helps you to keep track of the expenses in real time. Bills on
            email? You simply fwd the email and the app will attach it to
            correct expense. Simple invoicing is great. And integration with
            Elster lets you do the Vat returns automatically.
